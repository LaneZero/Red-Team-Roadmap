Red Team

1.	What is Red Teaming? From a historical perspective, red teaming originated from the exercises of the US military during the Cold War, where the Soviet Army represented the Red Team and the US Army represented the Blue Team. However, in the realm of cybersecurity, red teaming refers to simulating hostile or adversarial attacks. Generally, if you aim to work as a red teamer, you'll be assigned various tasks depending on the job role, requiring skills across different domains. For example:
Finding and enhancing the execution chain of malware for Blue Team evaluation, such as the following chain: url > zip > js > curl > .dll
Discovering new and diverse methods to bypass security mechanisms like Application whitelisting, UAC bypass, AV evasion, EDR evasion, etc.
2.	What Red Teaming is Not? Penetration testing itself is not red teaming; rather, it's one of the penetration techniques, such as web hacking.
3. Where is Red Teaming Used?
Offensive Security maturity model
 
Figure 1Cymulate offensive security matuirty model
Organizations have various levels of offensive security maturity. 
Vulnerability scanning and Vulnerability Assessment are performed across all organizations.
Depending on the size of organizations, they either have an in-house penetration testing department, outsource this function, or even utilize bug bounty programs.
Organizations with blue teams use internal or external red teaming to assess team performance and discover security gaps.
Purple team exercises serve as a method to establish balance and aid in increasing the efficiency of red and blue teams to increase the goal of detection rates and reduce false positives.
Simulating APT groups for assessing the performance of defensive teams is highly practical.


4.	Steps for an Internal Red Team in an Organization:
•	Understanding the network, security equipment, and the presence or absence of sensors.
•	Preparing tests according to the network and security equipment and implementing them.
•	Discovering security gaps and reporting them to the blue team.
•	Reviewing and re-executing tests to ensure that the gaps have been addressed.
•	Advanced level of blue team maturity requires simulation of techniques or APT group activities to be performed by the red team. If an organization has reached maturity and has had at least 4 years of blue teaming, tests should be implemented at a higher level, focusing more on bypassing and observing detection and non-detection by the blue team. Additionally, malware development is one of the most important tasks.
5.	Types of Red Team Job Positions and Required Skills for Each Level of Job Positions:

6. Differences between Internal and External Red Teams:
Internal Red Teamer:
- Scope: Within the organization, checking internal security controls, security policies, and processes, simulating insider threat attacks and APT groups.
- Access Level: Knowledge of infrastructure, security systems, and sometimes self-SIEM.
- Objectives: Gap analysis, collaboration with blue teams, participation in incident response, threat hunting, and mitigation.

External Red Teamer:
- Scope: Organizations and affiliated companies, simulating APT attacks.
- Access Level: No knowledge of security equipment and infrastructure, no interaction with internal members.
- Objectives: Initial access and information extraction.
- Testing Rules: Conducting all tests without any destructive operations on organizational assets, no extraction of customer information and sensitive data like databases.

7. How to Become a Red Teamer:
Today, specialization in red teaming has become one of the trends in cybersecurity, and you may be interested in what exactly red teaming is, what it's for, whether you can become a red teamer, what knowledge is required, what skills are needed, and whether there are free resources for self-study or if you must attend specific classes.

12.	Does the MITRE ATT&CK framework provide complete coverage?
In general, MITRE ATT&CK is a community-driven security framework where many security companies report new techniques over time, and the MITRE team adds them after review, so this process is time-consuming, and MITRE is not updated in real-time. Sources for updating include threat intelligence reports, security researcher articles, post-incident reports released after organization hacks, blogs, and security researcher tweets, which can serve as sources to expand the coverage breadth of TTPs.
